## Questions for Team Reflection

As we work on this project, let's regularly revisit these fundamental questions:

### 1. What are you trying to do?
*Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.*

### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

### 4. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?

### 5. What are the risks?

### 6. How much will it cost?

### 7. How long will it take?

### 8. What are the mid-term and final "exams" to check for success?

*These questions should guide our decision-making and help us maintain clarity of purpose throughout the development process.
