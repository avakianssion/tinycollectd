# tinycollectd

A lightweight Rust-based tool to collect system metrics (CPU, uptime, disk usage, network stats, and more...) and send them as JSON over UDP at regular intervals.

This project was **inspired by [collectd](https://github.com/collectd/collectd)** — and born out of some frustrations while using it.  
The goal is to provide a simpler, smaller, and more modern alternative that’s easy? easier to configure and extend, or maybe not and this would be another terrible metrics collector that people hate using.

tinycollectd, also known as tinyd belongs to the people.
